# 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google
Monday, November 11 - Friday, November 15


## What is the 5-Day Generative AI Intensive Course?
It’s a 5-day online course on November 11 - 15 designed to help you deeply understand some of the fundamental technologies and techniques behind Generative AI. Created by a team of Google’s ML researchers and engineers, this program includes both conceptual deep dives and hands-on coding examples so you can tackle new Gen AI projects with confidence.


## What's being covered?
Day 1: Foundational Models & Prompt Engineering - Explore the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. Get trained with the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction.

Day 2: Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases - Learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases, including embedding methods, vector search algorithms, and real-world applications with LLMs, as well as their tradeoffs.

Day 3: Generative AI Agents - Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process.

Day 4: Domain-Specific LLMs - Delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.

Day 5: MLOps for Generative AI - Discover how to adapt MLOps practices for Generative AI and leverage Vertex AI's tools for foundation models and generative AI applications.
